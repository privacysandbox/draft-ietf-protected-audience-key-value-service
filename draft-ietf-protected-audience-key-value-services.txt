1.  Introduction

   Protected Audience (https://wicg.github.io/turtledove/) is a privacy
   advancing API that serves remarketing and custom audiences use cases.
   Key Value Services are trusted execution environment (TEE) based Key/
   Value databases that can be used to store and integrate real-time
   data into Protected Audiences Auctions.  The Protected Audience
   proposal leverages Key Value Services to incorporate real-time
   information into ad selection for both buyers and sellers.  This
   information could be used, for example, to add budgeting data about
   each ad.  These services provide a flexible mechanism for fetching
   and processing data.  While event-level logging is explicitly
   prohibited, the services may have operational side effects like
   monitoring to ensure security and prevent abuse.

1.1.  Scope

   This document provides a specification for the request and response
   message format that a client can use to communicate with the Key
   Value Service as part of the client's implementation of the Protected
   Audience API (https://wicg.github.io/turtledove/).

   This document does not describe distribution of private keys to the
   Key Value Service.

1.2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   The key word "client" is to be interpreted as an implementation of
   this document that creates Requests (Section 2.3) and consumes
   Responses (Section 2.4).  The key phrase "Key Value Service" is to be
   interpreted as an implementation of this document that consumes
   Requests and creates Responses.

2.  Message Format Specifications

2.1.  Overview

   To understand this document, it is important to know that the
   communication between the client and the remote services uses a
   request-response message exchange pattern.  On a high level, these
   request and response messages adhere to the following communication
   protocol:

   *  Data is transmitted over [HTTPS] using the POST method.

   *  Data within the request and response is encrypted with [HPKE].

   *  The core request and response data is encoded using [CBOR].

2.2.  HTTP Headers

   Requests MUST contain a cleartext HTTP Content-Type header with value
   message/ad-auction-trusted-signals-request.

   Responses MUST contain a cleartext HTTP Content-Type header with
   value message/ad-auction-trusted-signals-response.

2.2.1.  Encryption

   The Key Value Service uses [HPKE] with the following configuration
   for encryption:

   *  HPKE KEM ID (Key encapsulation mechanisms): 0x0020 DHKEM(X25519,
      HKDF-SHA256), see Section 1 of [HPKE]

   *  HPKE KDF ID (key derivation functions): 0x0001 HKDF-SHA256, see
      Section 7.2 of [HPKE]

   *  HPKE AEAD ID (Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data): AES-
      256-GCM, see Section 7.3 of [HPKE]

2.2.2.  Message Framing

   Before encryption and after decryption, the requests and responses
   have the following framing:

   +==========+========+=============+========+=============+=========+
   | Byte     | 0      | 0           | 1 to 4 | 5 to Size+4 | Size+5  |
   |          |        |             |        |             | to end  |
   +==========+========+=============+========+=============+=========+
   | Bits     | 7-2    | 1-0         | *      | *           | *       |
   +----------+--------+-------------+--------+-------------+---------+
   | Contents | Unused | Compression | Size   | Payload     | Padding |
   +----------+--------+-------------+--------+-------------+---------+

                                 Table 1

   The request/response is framed with this 5 byte header.

   The first byte is the format+compression byte.  The lower 2 bits
   specify the format and compression (Section 2.2.3).  The higher 6
   bits are currently unused.

   The following 4 bytes are the length of the request message in
   network byte order.

   Padding is applied differently for request and response and will be
   discussed in the respective sections.

2.2.3.  Format+compression byte

             +=============+================================+
             | Compression | Description                    |
             +=============+================================+
             |     0x00    | [CBOR], no compression         |
             +-------------+--------------------------------+
             |     0x01    | [CBOR], compressed in [Brotli] |
             +-------------+--------------------------------+
             |     0x02    | [CBOR], compressed in [GZIP]   |
             +-------------+--------------------------------+
             |     0x03    | Reserved                       |
             +-------------+--------------------------------+

                                 Table 2

   Requests are always uncompressed so the Format+compression byte is
   0x00.

   For responses, the byte value depends on the acceptCompression field
   (see Section 2.3.3) in the request and the server behavior.

2.3.  Request Data

   Requests are not compressed and have a tree-like hierarchy:

   *  Each request contains one or more partitions.  Each partition is a
      collection of keys that SHALL be processed together by the
      service.  Keys from separate partitions MUST NOT be processed
      together by the service.

   *  Each partition contains one or more key groups.  Each key group
      contains a list of tags set by the client.  Each key group
      contains a list of keys to be looked up in the service's internal
      datastore.

   *  Each partition has a unique identifier.  This allows the client to
      match the request partition with the corresponding partitionOutput
      (see Section 2.4.3.1) in the response.

   *  Each partition has a compression group field.  Results of
      partitions belonging to the same compression group can be
      compressed together in the response.  The responses for different
      compression groups will be compressed separately in the response
      (see Section 2.4.3.1).  Compressing the different groups
      separately avoids leaking the similarity of responses for
      different groups.

2.3.1.  Encryption

   The request is encrypted with [HPKE] with the configuration specified
   at Section 2.2.1.

   The request uses a similar encapsulated message format to that used
   by [OHTTP].

   Encapsulated Request {
     Key Identifier (8),
     HPKE KEM ID (16),
     HPKE KDF ID (16),
     HPKE AEAD ID (16),
     Encapsulated KEM Shared Secret (8 * Nenc),
     HPKE-Protected Request (..),
   }

   The service uses a repurposed [OHTTP] encapsulation mechanism (see
   Section 4.6 of [OHTTP]) for which it defines a new message/ad-
   auction-trusted-signals-request media type.

   Request encapsulation is similar to Section 4.3 of [OHTTP], only with
   the message/ad-auction-trusted-signals-request media type:

   1.  Construct a message header (hdr) by concatenating the values of
       the Key Identifier, HPKE KEM ID, HPKE KDF ID, and HPKE AEAD ID in
       network byte order.

   2.  Build a sequence of bytes (info) by concatenating the ASCII-
       encoded string "message/ad-auction-trusted-signals-request", a
       zero byte, and hdr.

   3.  Create a sending HPKE context by invoking SetupBaseS()
       (Section 5.1.1 (https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9180#section-5.1.1)
       of [HPKE]) with the public key of the receiver pkR and info.
       This yields the context sctxt and an encapsulation key enc.

   4.  Encrypt request by invoking the Seal() method on sctxt
       (Section 5.2 (https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9180#section-5.2) of
       [HPKE]) with empty associated data aad, yielding ciphertext ct.

   5.  Concatenate the values of hdr, enc, and ct.

   In pseudocode, this procedure is as follows:

 hdr = concat(encode(1, key_id),
              encode(2, kem_id),
              encode(2, kdf_id),
              encode(2, aead_id))
 info = concat(encode_str("message/ad-auction-trusted-signals-request"),
               encode(1, 0),
               hdr)
 enc, sctxt = SetupBaseS(pkR, info)
 ct = sctxt.Seal("", request)
 enc_request = concat(hdr, enc, ct)

   The client needs to save sctxt for decryption of the response (see
   Section 2.4.1).

   A Key Value Service endpoint decrypts this encapsulated message in a
   similar manner to [OHTTP] Section 4.3 (https://www.rfc-
   editor.org/rfc/rfc9458#name-encapsulation-of-requests), or more
   explicitly as follows:

   1.  Parse enc_request into key_id, kem_id, kdf_id, aead_id, enc, and
       ct.

   2.  Find the matching HPKE private key, skR, corresponding to key_id.
       If there is no matching key, return an error.

   3.  Build a sequence of bytes (info) by concatenating the ASCII-
       encoded string "message/ad-auction-trusted-signals-request"; a
       zero byte; key_id as an 8-bit integer; plus kem_id, kdf_id, and
       aead_id as three 16-bit integers.

   4.  Create a receiving HPKE context, rctxt, by invoking SetupBaseR()
       (Section 5.1.1 (https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9180#section-5.1.1)
       of [HPKE]) with skR, enc, and info.

   5.  Decrypt ct by invoking the Open() method on rctxt (Section 5.2
       (https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9180#section-5.2) of [HPKE]), with
       an empty associated data aad, yielding request and returning an
       error on failure.

   In pseudocode, this procedure is as follows:

 key_id, kem_id, kdf_id, aead_id, enc, ct = parse(enc_request)
 if version != 0 then return error
 info = concat(encode_str("message/ad-auction-trusted-signals-request"),
               encode(1, 0),
               encode(1, key_id),
               encode(2, kem_id),
               encode(2, kdf_id),
               encode(2, aead_id))
 rctxt = SetupBaseR(enc, skR, info)
 request, error = rctxt.Open("", ct)

   Key Value Services retain the HPKE context, rctxt, so that it can
   encapsulate a response.

2.3.2.  Framing and Padding

   The plaintext request message uses the framing described in
   Section 2.2.2.

   Messages MAY be zero padded.

2.3.3.  Request Schema

   The request is a [CBOR] encoded message with the following [CDDL]
   schema:

   compressionType = "none" / "gzip" / "brotli"

   request = {
       ? acceptCompression: [1* compressionType],
       ; A list of supported response compression algorithms; must contain at least one of "none", "gzip", "brotli"
       ? metadata: requestMetadata,
       ; Metadata that applies for the request as a whole.
       partitions: [1* partition],
       ; A list of partitions. Each must be processed independently. Accessible by user-defined functions.
   }

   requestMetadata = {
       ? hostname: tstr,
       ; The hostname of the top-level frame calling runAdAuction
   }

   partition = {
       id: uint,
       ; Unique id of the partition in this request. Used by responses to refer to request partitions.
       compressionGroupId: uint,
       ; Unique id of a compression group in this request. Only partitions belonging to the same compression group will be compressed together in the response
       ? metadata: partitionMetadata,
       ; Partition-level metadata.
       arguments: [* requestArgument],
       ; One group of keys and common attributes about them
   }
   ;Single partition object. A collection of keys that can be processed together.

   partitionMetadata = {
       ? experimentGroupId: tstr,
       ? slotSize: tstr,
       ? allSlotsRequestedSizes: tstr,
   }

   requestArgument = {
       ? tags: [1* tstr],
       ; List of tags describing this group's attributes. These MAY be picked from the list of available tags in {{tags}}.
       ? data: [* tstr],
       ; List of keys to get values for.
   }

2.3.3.1.  Available Tags

   Each key group is expected to have exactly one tag from the following
   list:

      +=======================+=====================================+
      | Tag                   | Description                         |
      +=======================+=====================================+
      | interestGroupNames    | Names of interest groups in the     |
      |                       | encompassing partition.             |
      +-----------------------+-------------------------------------+
      | keys                  | "keys" represent the keys to be     |
      |                       | looked up from the service's        |
      |                       | internal datastore.                 |
      +-----------------------+-------------------------------------+
      | renderUrls            | "renderUrls" represent URLs for     |
      |                       | advertisements to be looked up from |
      |                       | the service's internal datastore.   |
      +-----------------------+-------------------------------------+
      | adComponentRenderUrls | "adComponentRenderUrls" represent   |
      |                       | component URLs for advertisements   |
      |                       | to be looked up from the service's  |
      |                       | internal datastore.                 |
      +-----------------------+-------------------------------------+

                                  Table 3

2.3.4.  Generating a Request

   This section describes how the client MAY form and serialize request
   messages in order to fetch values from the Trusted Key Value server.

   This algorithm takes as input: * an [HPKE] public key. * a key id
   integer associated with public key. * a metadata map for global
   configuration, where both keys and values are strings. * a
   compression groups, which is a list of groups, each with the
   following parameters: * a compressionGroupId integer identifier of
   this compression group.  * a partitions, which is a list of
   partitions belonging to this compression group.  Each partition has
   the following parameters: * an id integer identifier of this
   partition.  * a namespace map whose keys are strings and values are
   list of strings.  * a metadata map whose keys and values are strings.

   The output is an [HPKE] ciphertext encrypted request and a context
   request context.

   1.   Let request map be an empty map.

   2.   Let partitions be an empty array.

   3.   For each group in compression groups:

   4.   For each partition in group's partitions: 1.  Let p be an empty
        map.  1.  Set p["compressionGroupId"] to group's
        compressionGroupId.  1.  Set p["id"] to partition's id.  1.  Set
        p["metadata"] to partition's metadata.  1.  Let arguments be an
        empty array.  1.  For each tag → value in partition's namespace:

        1.  If tag is one of Section 2.3.3.1:

        2.  Let argument be an empty map.

        3.  Set argument["tags"] to [tag].

        4.  Set argument["data"] to value.

        5.  Insert argument into arguments.  1.  Set p["arguments"] to
            arguments.  1.  Insert p into partitions.

   5.   Set request map["metadata"] to metadata.

   6.   Set request map["partitions"] to partitions.

   7.   Set request map["acceptCompression"] to ["none", "gzip"].

   8.   [CBOR] encode request map to payload.

   9.   Create a framed payload, as described in Section 2.2.2:

        1.  Create a Section 2.2.2 header framing header.

        2.  Set framing header's Compression to 1.

        3.  Set framing header's Size to the size of payload.

        4.  Set framed payload to the concatenation of framing header
            and payload.

        5.  Padding MAY be added to framed payload.

        6.  Return an empty request on failure of any of the previous
            steps.

   10.  [HPKE] encrypt framed payload using public key and key id as in
        Section 2.3.1 to get the [HPKE] encrypted ciphertext request and
        [HPKE] encryption context request context.

   11.  Return request and request context.

2.3.5.  Parsing a Request

   This section describes how the Key Value Service MUST deserialize
   request messages from the client.

   The algorithm takes as input a serialized request message from the
   client and a list of HPKE private keys (along with their
   corresponding key IDs).

   The output is either an error sent back to the client, an empty
   message sent back to the client, or a request message the Key Value
   Service can consume along with an HPKE context.

   1.   Let encrypted request be the request received from the client.

   2.   Let error_msg be an empty string.

   3.   Decrypt encrypted request by using the input private key
        corresponding to key_id as described in Section 2.3.1, to get
        the decrypted message and rctxt.

        1.  If decryption fails, return failure.

        2.  Else, save the decrypted output as framed request and save
            rctxt.

   4.   Remove and extract the first 5 bytes from framed request as the
        framing header (described in Section 2.2.2), removing them from
        framed request.

        1.  If the framing header's Compression field is not 0x00 (no
            compression), return failure.

   5.   Let length be equal to the framing header's Size field.

   6.   If length is greater than the length of the remaining bytes in
        framed request, return failure.

   7.   Take the first length remaining bytes in framed response as
        decodable request, discarding the rest.

   8.   [CBOR] decode decodable request into the message represented in
        Section 2.3.3.  Let this be processed request.

        1.  If decoding fails, return failure.

   9.   If no partitions are present, return failure.

   10.  Set compressionGroupMap to an empty map.

   11.  For each partition in partitions:

        1.  Let partitionIds be an empty list.

        2.  Set partitionIds to compressionGroupMap[compression group
            id] if the map entry exists.

        3.  Append partition["id"] to partitionIds.

        4.  Set compressionGroupMap[compression group id] to
            partitionIds.

   12.  Return processed request, compressionGroupMap, and rctxt.

2.4.  Response Data

   The response is an HPKE encrypted message sent as a Response to a
   Request, containing a framed top-level CBOR encoded payload that
   itself can contain multiple, possibly compressed, CBOR encoded
   messages.

2.4.1.  Encryption

   The response uses a similar encapsulated response format to that used
   by [OHTTP].

   Encapsulated Response {
     Nonce (8 * max(Nn, Nk)),
     AEAD-Protected Response (..),
   }

   The response uses the a similar encapsulated response format to that
   used by [OHTTP] (see Section 4.4 of [OHTTP]), but with the custom
   message/ad-auction-trusted-signals-response media type instead of
   message/bhttp response:

   1.  Export a secret (secret) from context, using the string "message/
       ad-auction-trusted-signals-response" as the exporter_context
       parameter to context.Export; see Section 5.3 (https://www.rfc-
       editor.org/rfc/rfc9180.html#name-secret-export) of [HPKE].  The
       length of this secret is max(Nn, Nk), where Nn and Nk are the
       length of the AEAD key and nonce that are associated with
       context.

   2.  Generate a random value of length max(Nn, Nk) bytes, called
       response_nonce.

   3.  Extract a pseudorandom key (prk) using the Extract function
       provided by the KDF algorithm associated with context.  The ikm
       input to this function is secret; the salt input is the
       concatenation of enc (from enc_request) and response_nonce.

   4.  Use the Expand function provided by the same KDF to create an
       AEAD key, key, of length Nk -- the length of the keys used by the
       AEAD associated with context.  Generating aead_key uses a label
       of "key".

   5.  Use the same Expand function to create a nonce, nonce, of length
       Nn -- the length of the nonce used by the AEAD.  Generating
       aead_nonce uses a label of "nonce".

   6.  Encrypt response, passing the AEAD function Seal the values of
       aead_key, aead_nonce, an empty aad, and a pt input of response.
       This yields ct.

   7.  Concatenate response_nonce and ct, yielding an Encapsulated
       Response, enc_response.  Note that response_nonce is of fixed
       length, so there is no ambiguity in parsing either response_nonce
       or ct.

   In pseudocode, this procedure is as follows:

secret = context.Export("message/ad-auction-trusted-signals-response", max(Nn, Nk))
response_nonce = random(max(Nn, Nk))
salt = concat(enc, response_nonce)
prk = Extract(salt, secret)
aead_key = Expand(prk, "key", Nk)
aead_nonce = Expand(prk, "nonce", Nn)
ct = Seal(aead_key, aead_nonce, "", response)
enc_response = concat(response_nonce, ct)

   Clients decrypt an Encapsulated Response by reversing this process.
   That is, Clients first parse enc_response into response_nonce and ct.
   Then, they follow the same process to derive values for aead_key and
   aead_nonce, using their sending HPKE context, sctxt, as the HPKE
   context, context.

   The Client uses these values to decrypt ct using the AEAD function
   Open.  Decrypting might produce an error, as follows:

   response, error = Open(aead_key, aead_nonce, "", ct)

2.4.2.  Framing and Padding

   The plaintext response message uses the framing described in
   Section 2.2.2.

   Padding is applied with sizes as multiples of 2^n KBs ranging from 0
   to 2MB.  So the valid response sizes will be [0, 128B, 256B, 512B,
   1KB, 2KB, 4KB, 8KB, 16KB, 32KB, 64KB, 128KB, 256KB, 512KB, 1MB, 2MB].

   If the response message is larger than 2MB, an error is returned.

2.4.3.  Response Schema

   The response MAY be compressed.  The compression is applied
   independently to each compression group.  That means, the response
   object mainly contains a list of compressed blobs, each for one
   compression group.  Each blob is for outputs of one or more
   partitions, sharing the same compressionGroup value as specified in
   the request.

   The response is a [CBOR] encoded message with the following [CDDL]
   schema:

   response = {
     ? compressionGroups : [* compressionGroup]
   }

   compressionGroup = {
     ? compressionGroupId: uint,
     ; Partition outputs with the same `compressionGroupId` specified in the request
     ; are compressed together.
     ? ttl_ms: uint,
     ; Adtech-specified TTL for client-side caching. In milliseconds. Unset means no caching.
     ? content: bstrs
     ; Compressed CBOR binary string using the algorithm specified in the request
     ; For details see compressed response content schema below.
   }

2.4.3.1.  CompressionGroup

   The content of each compressionGroup is a serialized [CBOR] list of
   partition outputs.  This object contains actual key value results for
   partitions in the corresponding compression group.  The uncompressed,
   deserialized [CBOR] content has the following [CDDL] schema:

   compressionGroup = [* partitionOutput]
   ; Array of PartitionOutput objects

   partitionOutput = {
     id: uint
     ; Unique id of the partition from the request
     ? keyGroupOutputs: [* keyGroupOutput]
   }

   keyGroupOutput = {
     tags: [* tstr]
     ; List of tags describing this key group's attributes
     ? keyValues: {
       ; At least one key-value pair if present
       * tstr => tstr
     }
     ; One value to be returned in response for one key
     ; If a keyValues object exists, it must at least contain one key-value pair.
     ; If no key-value pair can be returned, the keyGroupOutput object should not be in the response
   }

2.4.4.  Structured keys response specification

   Structured keys are keys that the client is aware of and the client
   can use the response to do additional processing.  The value of these
   keys must abide by the following schema for the client to
   successfully parse them.

   Note that they must be serialized to string when stored as the value.

2.4.4.1.  InterestGroupResponse

   The schema below is defined following the spec by https://json-
   schema.org.  For values for keys from the interestGroupNames
   namespace, they must conform to the following schema, prior to being
   serialized to string.

   {
       "title": "tkv.response.v2.InterestGroupResponse",
       "description": "Format for value of keys in groups tagged 'interestGroupNames'",
       "type": "object",
       "additionalProperties": false,
       "properties": {
           "priorityVector": {
               "type": "object",
               "patternProperties": {
                   ".*": {
                       "description": "signals",
                       "type": "number"
                   }
               }
           },
           "updateIfOlderThanMs": {
               "description": "This optional field specifies that the interest group should be updated if the interest group hasn't been joined or updated in a duration of time exceeding `updateIfOlderThanMs` milliseconds. Updates that ended in failure, either parse or network failure, are not considered to increment the last update or join time. An `updateIfOlderThanMs` that's less than 10 minutes will be clamped to 10 minutes.",
               "type": "unsigned integer"
           }
       }
   }

2.4.5.  Generating a Response

   The Key Value Service runs user-defined functions (UDF) as part of
   request handling and response generation.  User-Defined Functions
   (UDFs) are custom functions implemented by adtech that encapsulate
   adtech-specific business logic for processing partitions within the
   Key Value Service.  These functions are executed within a sandboxed
   environment without network or disk access, but have read access to
   data loaded into the Key Value Service.  Each UDF receives a single
   partition object from the client request as input.  The output of a
   UDF is a partitionOutput object that contains the results of
   processing the partition.

   The below algorithm describes how the Key Value Service MAY generate
   a response to a request.

   The input is a list of deterministically encoded CBOR
   (https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8949.html#name-deterministically-
   encoded-c) partitionOutputs in Section 2.4.3 as well as the
   compressionGroupMap and the HPKE receiver, rctxt, context saved in
   Section 2.3.5.  Assume that this response is to a request that
   includes gzip in acceptCompression.

   The output is a response to be sent to a Client.

   1.  Create an empty payload object, corresponding to Section 2.4.3.

   2.  Set compression groups to an empty list.

   3.  Set partitionOutputMap to an empty map.

   4.  For each partitionOutput in the list of partitionOutputs:

       1.  Set partitionOutputMap[partitionOutput["id"]] to
           partitionOutput.

   5.  For each (compression group id, partition ids) in
       compressionGroupMap:

       1.  Create an empty compression group object, corresponding to
           Section 2.4.3.1.

       2.  Set cbor partitions array to an empty CBOR array.

       3.  For each partition id in partition ids:

           1.  Set partition output to partitionOutputMap[partition id].

               1.  On failure to find the partition id, continue.

           2.  Append partition output to cbor partitions array.

       4.  Set cbor serialized payload to the CBOR serialized cbor
           partitions array.

           1.  On serialization failure, continue.

       5.  Set compression group content to the [GZIP] compressed cbor
           serialized payload.

           1.  On failure, continue.

       6.  Set compression group["compressionGroupId"] to compression
           group id

       7.  Set compression group["content"] to compression group
           content.

       8.  Add compression group to compression groups.

   6.  Set payload["compressionGroups"] to compression groups.

   7.  Create a framed payload, as described in Section 2.2.2:

       1.  Create a framing header.

       2.  Set the framing header Compression to one of 2.

       3.  Set the framing header Size to the size of compressed
           payload.

       4.  Let framed payload equal the result of prepending the framing
           header to payload.

       5.  Padding MAY be added to framed payload.

       6.  Return an empty response on failure of any of the previous
           steps.

   8.  Let response equal the result of the encryption and encapsulation
       of framed payload with rctxt, as described in Section 2.4.1.
       Return an empty response on failure.

   9.  Return response.

2.4.6.  Parsing a Response (#response-parsing)

   This section describes how a conforming Client MUST parse and
   validate a response from a Trusted Key Value service.

   It takes as input the request context, returned from Section 2.3.4,
   and an encrypted response, an array of bytes from the Key Value
   Service generated by Section 2.4.5.

   The output is a results which is a list of result with the following
   parameters: * index, a tuple of an integer and an integer, records
   the compression group id and partition id. * interestGroupNames, null
   or a map, whose keys and values are strings. * keys, null or a map,
   whose keys and values are strings. * renderUrls, null or a map, whose
   keys and values are strings. * adComponentRenderUrls, null or a map,
   whose keys and values are strings.

   1.   Use request context as the context to decrypt encrypted response
        and obtain framed response, returning failure if decryption
        fails.

   2.   Remove and extract the first 5 bytes from framed response as the
        framing header (described in Section 2.2.2), removing them from
        framed response.

   3.   If framing header's Compression field is not 0 or 2, return
        failure.

   4.   Let length be equal to the framing header's Size field.

   5.   If length is greater than the length of the remaining bytes in
        framed response, return failure.

   6.   Take the first length remaining bytes in framed response as
        serialized response, discarding the rest.

   7.   [CBOR] decode the serialized response into response, returning
        failure if decoding fails.

   8.   If response is not a map, return failure.

   9.   If response["compressionGroups"] does not exist, or is not an
        array, return failure.

   10.  Let results be an empty array.

   11.  For each group in response["compressionGroups"]:

        1.  If group is not a map, return failure.

        2.  If group["content"] does not exist, return failure.

        3.  Set serialized content to the result of decompressing
            group["content"] according to the compression algorithm
            specified in the framing header's Compression field,
            returning failure if decompression fails.

        4.  [CBOR] decode the serialized content into content, returning
            failure if decoding fails.

        5.  If content is not an array, return failure.

        6.  For each partition in content:

            1.  If partition is not a map, return failure.

            2.  If partition["keyGroupOutputs"] does not exist, or is
                not an array, return failure.

            3.  Initialize an empty result.

            4.  For each output in partition["keyGroupOutputs"]:

                1.  If output is not a map, return failure.

                2.  If output["tags"] does not exist, or is not an
                    array, return failure.

                3.  If output["keyValues"] does not exist or is not a
                    map, return failure.

                4.  Let key value be an empty map.

                5.  For each key → value in output["keyValues"]:

                    1.  If key is not a string, return failure.

                    2.  If value is not a map, return failure.

                    3.  If value["value"] does not exist, or is not a
                        string, return failure.

                    4.  Set key value[key] to value["value"].

                6.  If output["tags"] equals to "interestGroupNames":

                    1.  Set result's interestGroupNames to key value.

                7.  Otherwise, if output["tags"] equals to "keys":

                    1.  Set result's keys to key value.

                8.  Otherwise, if output["tags"] equals to "renderUrls":

                    1.  Set result's renderUrls to key value.

                9.  Otherwise, if output["tags"] equals to
                    "adComponentRenderUrls":

                    1.  Set result's adComponentRenderUrls to key value.

            5.  If partition["dataVersion"] exists, Set result's
                dataVersion to partition["dataVersion"].

            6.  Set result index to tuple of group["compressionGroupId"]
                and partition["id"].

            7.  Append result to results.

   12.  Return results.

3.  Security Considerations

   The Key Values Service is run by adtechs as service operators and
   relies on [HPKE] to encrypt communication between the client and the
   Key Value Service endpoint.  This protects the confidentiality and
   integrity of requests and responses, particularly between the point
   of HTTPS/TLS termination and the TEE.  By encrypting messages at this
   stage, [HPKE] prevents service operators from reading or modifying
   them in transit.  While HPKE encryption protects message contents,
   the size of encrypted messages is still observable.  This could
   potentially be exploited as a side-channel to leak information.
   Implementations MAY employ padding techniques described in this
   document to mitigate this risk.

   To achieve specific privacy goals, clients can break up the request
   into separate partitions.  Partitions prevent one interest group from
   influencing the response to another one.  This isolation ensures that
   information remains compartmentalized and prevents unintended
   interference between interest groups.

   A cross-site tracking risk exists where an adtech could attempt to
   link a user’s identity across different websites.  An interest group
   owner could join a user to interest groups on multiple sites and
   observe changes in the request’s overall compression ratio.  This
   protocol mitigates this risk by compressing interest groups for
   different sites separately.

   An implementation should ensure that public keys used for encryption
   are obtained from a trusted source to prevent impersonation and
   unauthorized access.  Private keys should be stored securely to
   prevent compromise.

4.  Privacy Considerations

   (https://github.com/privacysandbox/protected-auction-services-
   docs/blob/main/key_value_service_trust_model.md).
